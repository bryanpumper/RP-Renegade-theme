For your larger varieties, it&rsquo;s best to get dwarf plants. &nbsp;You can stake them as high as the canopy.

They will help pollinate inside the pod whilst the bigger pollinators like bees can&rsquo;t get in. Have a look to see what they are doing. They may be feeding on nasty pests like scale insects.

              "answer": "<p><strong>For Mature Plants<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It does depend on the weather and how established your plants are. For a start, note the canopy is permeable, so if it&rsquo;s ever raining, it&rsquo;s getting watered like any other garden. Also, once your plants are established you don&rsquo;t have to water them as much. They are being serviced by the water reservoirs below, and the wicking system. I.e.: even when the top soil looks and feels dry, you will notice the plants still thrive. They are drinking from the wetter soil below via the wicking bed. Don&rsquo;t overwater the Vegepod &ndash; the beauty of the wicking system is its water efficiency. It doesn&rsquo;t need the typical amount of watering that a standard garden would.<\/p>\n<p>As an example, a customer didn&rsquo;t water their pods last year for the 6 months of autumn \/ winter, as Sydney had regular coastal rain every couple of weeks and the weather was cool. This continually replenished the reservoirs. The warmer months obviously use more. Even in a Sydney summer though when you go away the established plants will be self-watered and okay for up to 2 to 4 weeks without rain or watering! Every time you get rain or use the misters or manually water the pod, your plants are getting watered and the water leaches down through the soil to replenish the reservoirs .<\/p>\n<p><strong>For Seedlings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having said all that, when your seedlings are just babies, or the summer days are really cooking, we recommend using the mist spray for at least three minutes per day until the seedlings establish. Once they have decent roots sent below or the super hot days are finished, you&rsquo;ll no longer need to spray. If in doubt, remember, the plants tell the story. Are they drying or wilting? Give &lsquo;em a water!<\/p>",

              "answer": "<p>We have never really had any problems with pollination or fertilisation over the years, and we have grown pretty much everything in the Vegepods. This is due to a few factors:<\/p>\n<p>- So many fruits these days are self-pollinating varieties.<\/p>\n<p>- The bees get all the glory but pollination is not solely performed by the larger pollinators like bees and butterflies. Tiny insect pollinators, such as ants and small beetles, are still active. (We are bee lovers too by the way, we have both native and euro hives at Shedquarters!)<\/p>\n<p>- Pollination also occurs via wind \/ movement which happens thanks to the permeable canopy.<\/p>\n<p>Also remember that for all the leafy greens, herbs and root vegetables we don&rsquo;t want or need to go to flower \/ seed anyway!<\/p>\n<p>The only things we have ever really bothered giving some attention (i.e: some finger poking) are cucumbers and zucchinis just to make sure. However, for such big vine growers, we sometimes take the canopy off once they are bursting against the canopy walls anyway. Once the cover is off the bigger pollinators can have access.<\/p>",

This is not uncommon and can take time to manifest within the pod, especially if the pests are only at the egg stage. Most nurseries do not protect their plants like our canopies do.<\/p>\n<p>If it&rsquo;s curl grubs, these are brought in via your soil. They will mow down your seedlings like a chainsaw and also eat and destroy roots. Either give your soil a good raking through to clean them out, or get new soil.<\/p>\n<p>The most common green grub is the notorious and ubiquitous white butterfly. Most new podders are indeed flummoxed, because you have already rationalised that it&rsquo;s impossible for the butterfly to squeeze through the canopy. How did they get in there, you ask?! Well their eggs are deposited as tiny single sporadic eggs, so they&rsquo;re not as easy to see as bigger eggs or batched eggs. You need to look hard. They are the size of a pin head, yellow and cylinder shaped. They are also often on the underside of leaves, to make it even trickier!<\/p>\n<p>Always check your seedlings and rub off any eggs and\/or their green grubs before transplanting to your pod. (Their favourite dish is kale and the other brassicas like broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower.)<\/p>",

              "answer": "<p>The misters produce a high volume of super fine mist. The mist will cover most of the plants and soil area in your pod, but you are correct, they do not necessarily reach into the corner extremities of the pod. This is not a problem for established plants because what we are basically aiming for is to have all the water leach down through the soil, and replenish the wicking reservoirs at the base. That&rsquo;s where established plants get the vast majority of their water from. Even if ALL the top soil was dry, for example, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. Technically you could have all the water enter from beneath the soil and the wicking job still does the job. We didn&rsquo;t design it like that, however, as it is indeed natural to have soil dampened from above too. We emulate nature as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all of this, if your plants are still tiny seedlings without decent roots to drink from the wells, it is recommended to water by hand the whole lot until they establish.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Read more about the Vegepod's self-watering system by reading our blog '<a href=\"\/blogs\/news\/vegepod-wicking-system-explained\" title=\"The Vegepod Wicking System Explained\">The Vegepod Wicking Bed System Explained<\/a>'<\/p>",

In general, veggies need as much sunlight as possible to grow well. At least 4 hours of direct sunlight is recommended for most veggies and herbs. Having said that, the 17% shade provided by our mesh does help against those real scorcher days.<\/p>\n<p>The canopy is permeable so it breathes and allows airflow for plant respiration. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t cook and kill your plants on hot days, like many non-permeable greenhouse plastic covers out there. So, it&rsquo;s fine to keep the canopy down all day. Likewise, the permeability allows rain to go through, so no need to open for watering during those periods.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from creating a perfect micro-climate for plant growth, the main point of the cover is to keep pests at bay. It clearly therefore needs to be down to achieve this.<\/p>",

You can either drape the cloth over the canopy or peg it to the Vegepod&rsquo;s poles. Remember, we chose the lowest shade rate in commercial grade crop mesh, to allow as much light in as possible for ideal veggie growing&hellip;and to cater for those customers who only get a few hours sun a day. However, on hot days, the cover is only 17% shade, so adding a bit of green shade cloth on those days is recommended.<\/p>\n<p>If your plants are still young seedlings and unestablished this is particularly recommended. Whilst still small seedlings, their roots have yet to take a good hold or grow much towards the lower and wetter regions of the wicking base. Until they get a bit bigger and more established, a good 3 to 5 minutes of daily mist spray or manual watering is also recommended.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Want to know more about our shade covers and managing the Pod in summer?

This ensures no leaching of chemicals and maintain organic status for soils, unlike treated timbers or iron beds. Some think it may be better to utilise recycled plastics to help the environment as an added bonus, but unfortunately such plastics have a myriad of unknown plastics in every single batch and could not warrant a food-safe check for every lot.

Take your time and literally run your fingers over top and and bottom side of every leaf and squish all of those buggers for good.

However if your greens are decimated already or you have a timid heart or you just can&rsquo;t be bothered, then rip out the infested plants and start again.

              "answer": "<p>Firstly, note the fungus gnats or sciarid flies are not bred in the water reservoirs&nbsp;below to make their way up into the soil and plants. The larvae are either brought in with your soil or&nbsp;flies are attracted to damp spots with lots of organic matter&nbsp;&nbsp;(which is what is in abundance in most potting mixes, or rotting leaves above the potting mix)&nbsp;if the canopy is left open. The flies will fly in and lay eggs in the top&nbsp;layer of the potting mix.&nbsp;The Vegepod reservoir&nbsp;wells don&rsquo;t stagnate as they have an overflow hole to allow regular flush outs when there is lots of rain or you can purposely water the pods through from the top.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>If you notice them then also&nbsp;STOP watering. The top layer of soil in a Vegepod should generally be dry. &nbsp;You should always&nbsp;place your vegepods in sunny locations that gives as at least 6 hours direct sunlight a day, that is best for veggie growing anyway, and will ensure you don&rsquo;t get any wet\/damp related pests or fungi probs.&nbsp;Dead foliage attracts the gnats so always clean away anything you don&rsquo;t intend eating.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>One solution to rid the gnats altogether is a biological control in the form of a nematode that is introduced to the soil. Apart from using the predatory nematodes (check your local producer for supply), another&nbsp;option&nbsp;is to kill any adult flies that are hanging around above the potting mix. They lay eggs which hatch into the larvae that do the damage. A sticky trap is a good non-toxic way to get the flies (see for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bunnings.com.au\/trappit-yellow-sticky-insect-garden-trap-5-pack_p2960969\">https:\/\/www.bunnings.com.au\/trappit-yellow-sticky-insect-garden-trap-5-pack_p2960969<\/a>).&nbsp;Stopping the flies will stop the larvae that cause the problem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here is a photo of fungus&nbsp;gnat larvae which could be in the potting mix.

              "answer": "<p>The best choices for a vegepod that is only getting sun for part of the day is to grow crops where the leaves are the harvested part of the plant. In other words parents like spinach, silver beet, lettuce, rocket and herbs such as mint, basil, thyme and oregano. Avoid crops such as tomatoes, beans and eggplants that rely on flowering and fruiting to produce because the reduced sunlight hours will reduce the amount of flowers and therefore fruits that are produced. On the flip side of the coin, lower light levels tend to result in extra foliage to try and catch the available light and hence you will get a reasonable harvest of leaves.&nbsp;<\/p>",

              "answer": "<p>The benefits of worm juice come in several ways as follows:<\/p>\n<p>It has a very well balanced nutrient content usually depending what your worms have been fed.&nbsp; If they have had the usual diet of things like kitchen scraps and manure these materials have the same&nbsp; balance of nutrients that plants need for optimal growth.&nbsp; Humus which is the end result of the breakdown of organic materials. Humus builds a soil's ability to store more water and nutrients Beneficial microbes from the worm's gut is in the juice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Storing the juice for more than a week or so will greatly reduce the quantity of beneficial microbes and for that reason we like to use it as fresh as possible.&nbsp; However, your stored juice will still have the full benefits of points 1 and 2. So for that reason it will still be good to use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Want to know more about making worm tea for your garden?

BUT, If you really don&rsquo;t want to manually water and you want to use the misters \/ use a timer for example, then there is a way to attach your misters to internal house sink taps anyway.

A plant's roots will locate this moisture hence watering from below.<\/p>\n<p>Established plants can last weeks without watering and in cooler times your plants may not require water for months at a time.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to water seeds and seedlings daily for a week or more. After that the reservoir will have enough water to keep the plant healthy. It is a good idea to reduce watering significantly once the plant is established.

If it rains during this period then don’t water at all.<\/p>\n<p>After 10 days your seedling’s roots will have located the necessary water source for survival and the reservoir will be full. Each plant differs on how much water it requires. Some plants like basil will send their roots into the reservoir itself. Hold right back on watering now – Base your watering on the season and weather. If it is winter and there is patchy rain don’t water at all. If it is mid summer and 30 degrees with no rain in sight then give them 3 minutes everyday.<\/p>\n<p>You can be neglectful and still get tremendous growing results. We have seen Vegepods left for 6 weeks through January and have still been fine.<\/p>\n<p>If you are going away for more than 2 weeks in summer it might be an idea to get a 24hr tap timer (around $50) and have it come on daily for 2 or 3 minutes.<\/p>"

These will help lighten the soil allowing plants roots to grow more easily. They also retain water so you are able to reduce the amount of watering. You will need to look for this online as most garden centres only sell it in 5 litre bags. A large Vegepod can use 100 litres.<\/p>",

You can even fill it past the rim as over time it will settle lower.<\/p>\n<p>We use perlite at the bottom as the wicking properties of perlite are superior to potting mix. We fill the wells and 2cm on the trays as the first layer. We then add potting mix and cow manure in the bottom half combined with more of the perlite and mix this all together. (It is recommended you use a face- mask when pouring bagged potting mix.)<\/p>\n<p>The top half of the soil should contain the rest of the potting mix and perlite combined. It is a good idea to keep the cow manure lower so as to prevent the roots of seedlings from burning. The roots will soon find the fertiliser when the plant requires it.<\/p>",

They range in price a bit – from about $3 at the markets to about $6 or more in some of the garden centres. Things like lettuce, silverbeet or asian greens will come with 8 or 10 plants in a punnet.<\/p>\n<p>Of course quality varies – if the sellers punnets have just arrived they look great, a week later some of them are a little sad. Thats why markets are usually the best place to buy.<\/p>\n<h3>What to look out for<\/h3>\n<p>If they look healthy and vibrant then they generally are and will handle the transplant well. Always check the leaves of the seedlings, underneath as well. Grubs or aphids might be found, if so leave those alone. Grubs aren’t too bad in a covered Vegepod as you can find and eliminate them. But aphids are harder to control without using sprays.<\/p>\n<p>Carrot seedlings are difficult as you need to separate each plant very carefully, meaning you will be removing the soil from them. This will cause the plant distress and take a little longer to start growing. Individual punnets make life much easier especially leafy greens, they can rebound immediately and you can be eating them a few weeks later.<\/p>\n<h3>Watering in<\/h3>\n<p>Always give them a good watering in. Using the mist-spray for this is ideal as you won’t flatten your precious seedlings. If using a hose or watering can then pick them back up after watering.<\/p>",
